# Angular Tutorial

## Q1 Angular Tutorial?
Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google and a community of developers. It's used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and complex user interfaces and supports large-scale application development.

## Q2 Angular Introduction?
Angular is a popular open-source web application framework of Javascript. Angular was developed and maintained by Google and a community of developers. Angular is a powerful framework suitable for building large-scale, feature-rich applications. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-introduction)

## Q3 Angular MVC?
Angular doesn't strictly adhere to the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. instead, it follows a different architecture, which can be described as a variation of MVC called the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.

## Q4 Getting Started?
Getting started with Angular involves a few key steps to set up your development environment and create your first Angular application. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/getting-started)

## Q5 Angular Modules?
In Angular, modules play a crucial role in organizing and structuring an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Angular modules are TypeScript classes with an "@NgModule" decorator, which provides metadata that Angular needs to compile and run the application.

## Q6 Angular Pipes?
In Angular, pipes are a feature that allows us to transform data directly within our template before displaying it. Pipes are a simple way to format data for display, perform data manipulation, and apply transformations without modifying the underlying data itself.

## Q7 Angular Expression?
In Angular, expressions are JavaScript-like code snippets that are evaluated in the context of the Angular framework. They are typically used within template files to dynamically render data or manipulate the DOM. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-expression)

## Q8 Angular DOM?
In Angular, the Document Object Model (DOM) is the structure of the HTML elements that make up your Angular application. Angular provides a way to interact with and manipulate the DOM through templates, components, directives, and services. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-dom)

## Q9 Angular Directives?
In Angular, directives are a powerful feature that allows us to extend HTML with custom behaviour and create reusable components. They provide a way to encapsulate and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in a declarative manner. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-directives)

## Q10 Angular Data Binding?
Angular data binding is a powerful feature that allows us to establish a connection between the components of our application and the DOM (Document Object Model). It enables us to synchronize data between our TypeScript code (component class properties) and our HTML templates, ensuring that any changes to one are reflected in the other automatically.

## Q11 Angular Models?
In Angular, "models" typically refer to TypeScript classes or interfaces that represent the structure and behaviour of data within an application. These models are used to define the shape of objects and facilitate type-checking and code organization. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-models)

## Q12 Angular Controllers?
In Angular, components serve as the primary building blocks for organizing and managing the application's UI and behaviour. In earlier versions of AngularJS (Angular 1.x), controllers were used to define the behaviour of different parts of the application.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-controllers)

## Q13 Angular Events?
In Angular, events are actions or occurrences detected by the application that can trigger functionality or behaviour in response. Angular provides various ways to handle events, including event binding, event emitters, and RxJS Observables.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-events)

## Q14 Angular Select?
In Angular, we can use the "select tag" element to create dropdown menus. Select elements controls and allow users to choose one or more options from a list of predefined values.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-select)

## Q15 Angular Tables?
In Angular, Tables have been used to display structured data in a tabular format, such as lists of items, data grids, or reports. We can use Angular's data binding capabilities to dynamically populate tables with data from our components. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-tables)

## Q16 Angular Validations?
In Angular, Form validation allows us to enforce data integrity and ensure user input meets specific requirements. Form validation can be achieved using both template-driven forms and reactive forms.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-validations)

## Q17 Angular Services?
In Angular, services are classes that are responsible for encapsulating and providing shared functionality, data, or behaviour that can be used across multiple components or throughout an application. Services help to keep our code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-services)

## Q18 Angular HTTP?
In Angular, we can use the built-in HttpClientModule to make HTTP requests to a server. HttpClientModule makes HTTP requests using the browser's XMLHttpRequest interface and provides features such as request and response interception, error handling, and observables-based APIs.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-http)

## Q19 Angular Routing?
Angular's Routing enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks. It manages the browser's history stack and navigates to different parts of the application based on URL changes without the need for full-page reloads. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/angular/angular-routing)

## Q20 Angular Animations?
Angular provides a powerful animation system that allows us to create rich and interactive user interfaces with smooth animations and transitions. The angular animations module is built on top of the Web Animations API and provides a declarative way to define animations using CSS or Javascript.  We can use animations to create engaging user experiences, add visual feedback, and improve the overall usability of our application.
